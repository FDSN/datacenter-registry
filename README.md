# datacenter-registry

The FDSN data center registry contains a listing of data centers,
which (web) services are offered, and which data sets are available
from each.

Data centers [maintain their own entries](https://www.fdsn.org/datacenters/help/#registry-management)
after completing the data center registration.

For more information see http://www.fdsn.org/datacenters/help/

In particular, documentation for the [data set priorities](http://www.fdsn.org/datacenters/help/#data-set-priorities)
and for [service names](http://www.fdsn.org/datacenters/help/#service-names)

## Exchange format

Data center registry entries are exchanged in a JSON-based schema, which is
defined using [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) in this repository.

## Illustrative example

This repository contains an illustrative, reference example of a data
center entry.  The registry itself contains numerous entries of real
examples as needed.
